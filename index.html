			<p>I'm currently employed full time as an Associate Product Manager at <a href="http://99designs.com">99designs</a>. Before making the transition into product I was employed at 99designs as a Community Liaison and was working as a marketing consulant for <a href="http://ampsport.com">AMPSport</a>. In the past, I worked as news and sports photographer at the Cal Aggie and in film operations for UC Davis Footbal.</p>
			<p>I also like to dabble with various side projects and occassionally take on freelance web development projects. Check out the <a href="#projects">projects section</a> to see examples of some of my recent work or download <a href"#">my resume</a> to see a more detailed work history.</p>
